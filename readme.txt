Zanto Addon for detecting the user country and show his country flag in the language switcher. Redirect user to his country page

== Description ==

This plugin is a Zanto addon that detects the user country and shows his country flag next to the available languages.
You can also redirect visitors based on visitor country if user locale translation exists. E.g if you have a language with locale code
en_US, the code can be devided into the language part 'en' and the geographical part 'US'.
This plugin has an option to redirect according to the geographical parts of the locale codes of the languages served on your ZANTO translated site.

= How usefull is this?  =
Since flags do not equate to language and several countries share the same national language but different flags, the solution is to
show the country flag of the user next to the languages. A good example can be seen with the popular  <a href="http://paypal.com" title="paypal language switcher">pay pal</a> website.
